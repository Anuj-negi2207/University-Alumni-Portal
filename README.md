# University-Alumni-Portal
UAP (University Alumni Portal) is a platform where students can build-up networks and contact with the Alumni. 

The following features are our main target:
  1. Alumni Profile (Google Login, Name, Picture, Registration Number, LinkedIn profile, City)
  2. Alumni Yearbook (Aggregation of the Profile according to YOP)  
  3. Meeting Invitations as VIP/Guest of Honour
  4. Alumni Magazine (Words from Alumni)
